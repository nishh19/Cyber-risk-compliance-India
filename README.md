# Cyber Risk & Compliance Project ‚Äì India

A simulated end-to-end Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC) assessment for a fictional Indian fintech startup, PayNex FinTech Pvt. Ltd. This project aligns with real-world cybersecurity frameworks and regulations, including:

- ISO/IEC 27001:2022
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework
- India's Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act 2023
- RBI Cyber Security Framework

## üìå Key Highlights

- **Risks Identified**: Seven major simulated risks across critical domains including cloud security, data protection, and incident response, with detailed mitigation strategies
- **Compliance Status**:
  - ISO/NIST: Achieved 70% alignment with combined ISO 27001 and NIST CSF controls, indicating a strong baseline security posture.
  - DPDP Act:  Demonstrated 75% compliance with the stringent requirements of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023, highlighting key areas for improvement.
- **Policy Framework**: Comprehensive policies covering critical security domains.
- **Visual Tools**: Utilization of an interactive compliance dashboard and a clear risk heatmap for intuitive monitoring and reporting of GRC metrics.
